# Gemini FastAPI + Soft UI Frontend

## What this does
- Provides a FastAPI backend that proxies requests to Google Gemini (Generative Language API).
- A Soft UI (neumorphism) single-page frontend to interact with it.

**Security**: The server reads `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from environment variables (`.env`) â€” do NOT commit your real key to source control.
